Overview of the analysis: The urpose of this analysis is to determine if the business opportunity opening a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii is a feasible and potentially profitable idea. Surfing and ice cream sales are weather dependant. Therefore we must determine the over-all climate for the business with special focus on precipitation and temperature by analyzing mutiple weather stations and the weather data they collect.

Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Comparing the months of December and June to analyze weather patterns, it is clear there is not a tremendous difference between the temperatures. For example, the maximum temperature in June is 85 and 83 in December. It would seem the temperatures stay relatively consistent throughout the year.

Summary: It would be beneficial to conduct an additional query to gather more weather data for June and December with regard to precipitation and wind speeds. These are two elements that will affect sales of ice cream and surfing.
